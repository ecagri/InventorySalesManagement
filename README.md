## INVENTORY SALES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
A simple inventory and sales management system has been developed to explore the MVC architecture using ASP.NET. This project was created by following a [tutorial video series on YouTube](https://youtu.be/ROMDAwb0cOM?si=8Q0CCdsJ6Pr1UGbr).

The database consists of four tables: `Tbl_Category`, `Tbl_Product`, `Tbl_Sale`, and `Tbl_Customer`.

The system allows users to create and update categories, products, and customers, as well as record sales for specific customers and products.
